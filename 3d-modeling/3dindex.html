    <hr>
    <h3>Welcome to the process of creating three-dimensional representations of an object or a surface. 3D models are
        made within computer-based 3D modeling software, which we'll explore a little later. During the 3D modeling
        process, you can determine an object's size, shape, and texture. </h3>
    <br>
    <h3>3D modeling helps us view the world from a different perspective. It is like watching everything from a
        bird's-eye view as you can view it from all angles. </h3> <br>
    <h3>For more extensive uses, Civil engineers may use 3D models for surveying and other construction works. It is
        mainly used during the surveying of rural locations, dense forest areas, and other locations with a high degree
        of risk or uncertainty. Whereas Computer engineers may modify "Meshroom" & "Blender", open-source softwares, to
        further improve the debugging the bugs related with those softwares, and add customized features, which will
        help for the improvement of those softwares.</h3>

    <h3>For all of my projects, softwares like Agisoft Metashape Pro, Meshroom, Adobe Premiere Pro, Blender, Adobe
        Photoshop, etc. were used. </h3> <br>

                            at Kathmandu University (KU) and one day I went to visit him. And then I saw the structure
                            that was a building but was of a "nut" shape. I was in the beginning phases of learning
                            about 3D models. Though it was a huge structure, I had to make a 3D model of it because I
                            had never seen anything like it before. And here it is, My First Project!

                            came asking me about the school I studied at and its location. The relative didn't know much
                            about Google maps and a detailed view from my home to my school was not available on Google
                            maps. And then it hit me, why not make a map from my home to my school? And this is how the
                            map turned out to be!

                            and how 3D models were created. So one day he called me to describe how things worked. As my
                            house was located near his, I went there and instead of describing the process to him, I
                            made a map and 3D model of his locality. Here is a sample of the map.
